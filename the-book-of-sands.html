        No, unquestionably this is not — more geometrico — the best way of beginning my story. To claim that is it true is 
        nowadays the convention of every made-up story. Mine, however, is true. I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Av.+Belgrano,+Cdad.+Aut%C3%B3noma+de+Buenos+Aires,+Argentina/@-34.6142132,-58.397263,3a,75y,332.34h,91.65t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sejYvZDWlusl9lJa9byzj6A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-1.6479563496659466%26panoid%3DejYvZDWlusl9lJa9byzj6A%26yaw%3D332.3360575792065!7i16384!8i8192!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x95bccae7ac9e3577:0x73935b3443c92791!2sAv.+Belgrano,+Cdad.+Aut%C3%B3noma+de+Buenos+Aires,+Argentina!3b1!8m2!3d-34.6141829!4d-58.3972654!16s%2Fm%2F011q9f0z!3m5!1s0x95bccae7ac9e3577:0x73935b3443c92791!8m2!3d-34.6141829!4d-58.3972654!16s%2Fm%2F011q9f0z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">
         Belgrano Street</a> in Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I heard a knock at my door.
      </p>

      <p>
        I opened it and a stranger stood there. He was a <em>tall man</em>, with <em>nondescript features</em> — or perhaps it was my myopia
        that made them seem that way. Dressed in <em>gray</em> and carrying a <em>gray</em> suitcase in his hand, he had an unassuming look
        about him. I saw at once that he was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I realize that I had
        been misled by his <em>thin blond hair</em>, which was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost <em>white</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I found out that he came from the Orkneys.
        I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him — as it
        does now from me.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I sell Bibles,” he said. Somewhat pedantically, I replied, “In this house are several English Bibles, including
        the first — John Wicliffe’s. I also have Cipriano de Valera’s, Luther’s — which, from a literary viewpoint, is the
        worst — and a Latin copy of the Vulgate. As you see, it’s not exactly Bibles I stand in need of.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few moments of silence, he said, “I don’t only sell Bibles. I can show you a holy book I came across on the
        outskirts of Bikaner. It may interest you.” He opened the suitcase and laid the book on a table. It was an octavo
        volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that it had passed through many hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words “Holy Writ” and, below them,
        “<a href="https://www.past-india.com/photos-items/elphinstone-college-kala-ghoda-horse-trams-bombay-1895-pc/#iLightbox[gallery39193]/0">Bombay</a>.” “Nineteenth century, probably,” I remarked. “I don’t know,” he said. “I’ve never found out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I opened the book at random. The script was strange to me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor,
        were laid out in a double column, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles.
        In the upper corners of the pages were <button class="tag" data-note="arabic">Arabic numbers</button>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999. I turned
        the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries
        — an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy’s clumsy hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was at this point that the stranger said, “Look at the illustration closely. You’ll never see it again.” I noted
        my place and closed the book. At once, I reopened it. Page by page, in vain, I looked for the illustration of the
        anchor.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It seems to be a version of Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?” I said to hide my dismay. “No,” he
        replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he lowered his voice. “I acquired the book in a town out on the plain in
        exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Its owner did not know how to read. I suspect that he saw the Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest
        caste; nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow without contamination.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He told me his book was called the <em>Book of Sand</em>, because neither the book nor the sand has any beginning or end.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The stranger asked me to find the first page. I laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my thumb on the
        flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless. Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the cover and my
        thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the book.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Now find the last page.” Again I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely managed to stammer, “This can’t
        be.” Still speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, “It can’t be, but it is. The number of pages in this book is
        no more or less than infinite.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “None is the first page, none the last. I don’t know why they’re numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to suggest
        that the terms of an infinite series admit any number.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, “If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space. If time is
        infinite, we may be at any point in time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His speculations irritated me. “You are religious, no doubt?” I asked him. “Yes, I’m a Presbyterian. My conscience
        is clear. I am reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when I gave him the Word of God in exchange for his
        devilish book.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for, and I asked if he were just passing through this part of
        the world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a few days. It was then that I learned that he
        was a Scot from the Orkney Islands.
      </p>

      <p>
        I told him I had a great personal affection for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and Hume. “You mean
        Stevenson and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns"> Robbie Burns </a>,” he corrected.
      </p>

      <p>
        While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With feigned indifference, I asked, “Do you intend to offer
        this curiosity to the British Museum?” “No. I’m offering it to you,” he said, and he stipulated a rather high sum
        for the book.
      </p>

      <p>
        I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of my reach. After a minute or two, I came up with a scheme.
        “I propose a swap,” I said. “I’ll offer you the amount of my pension check and my black-letter Wicliffe Bible.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “A black-letter Wicliffe!” he murmured. I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and the book. He turned the
        leaves and studied the title page with all the fervor of a true bibliophile. “It’s a deal,” he said.
      </p>

      <p>
        It amazed me that he did not haggle. Only later was I to realize that he had entered my house with his mind made up
        to sell the book. Without counting the money, he put it away. We talked about India, about Orkney, and about the
        Norwegian jarls who once ruled it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was night when the man left. I have not seen him again, nor do I know his name. I thought of keeping the Book of
        Sand on the shelf, but in the end I decided to hide it behind the volumes of a broken set of <em>The Thousand and One
        Nights</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I went to bed and did not sleep. At three or four in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the impossible
        book and leafed through its pages. On one of them I saw engraved a mask.
      </p>

      <p>
        I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the misgiving
        that it might not truly be infinite. These twin preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thought of fire, but I feared that the burning of an <button class="tag" data-note="infinitebook">infinite book</button> might likewise prove
        infinite and suffocate the planet with smoke. Somewhere I recalled reading that the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before retirement, I worked at the Argentine National Library, which contains nine hundred thousand volumes. One
        day I went there and, slipping past a member of the staff and trying not to notice at what height or distance from
        the door, I lost the Book of Sand on one of the basement’s musty shelves.
